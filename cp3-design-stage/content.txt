Shhhhh! This is a virtual library.

Sometimes we need some help picking out a book to read. Luckily for you, I have a solution! 
Choose a category, and see its most popular books (which are all available as audiobooks 
on Spotify). Happy reading! :)

Finding audiobook playlists was hard/I didn't like many of them, so I curated many of the 
playlists for this project.

Romance: Romance books been celebrated for their exploration of emotional connections 
while also delivering engaging stories. Romance books (and things liked mostly by women 
in general) get a bad rap, but I think people are looking at the genre wrong. Romance is 
broad, and there are many subgenres, ranging from historical to sports. Each provide a 
unique perspective on something that has been discussed since the beginning of time. As 
long as there are people on this earth, there will be new ways to think about love. This 
is a list of some of the most popular romance books.

Classics: Classics are timeless works of literature that have had a profound impact on 
our culture, enduring through generations due to their universal themes, compelling 
characters, and masterful storytelling. However, the debate over what is considered a 
"classic" is ongoing and multifaceted. My definition of a classic is a book that has stuck 
with its readers and shaped how they read and view books as a whole. 
This is a (non-comprehensive!) list of what I consider to be classics. Your list of classics 
may be different, and that's amazing! Disagreements are the spice of life.

My Recommended Books: Here are books I've read and loved for various reasons. As you can see, 
I'm very into Black/Black-fem focused literature. However, the genres range from biographies to 
sci-fi to thrillers. I was introduced to some of these through electives I've taken in high school 
and college. Some of these were given to me by my english professor or recommended to me by
a friend. I found one of these books just browsing free audiobooks my library provides!

    Feel Free : Essays by Zadie Smith

Sci-fi/Fantasy: Science Fiction (Sci-fi) books are an interesting genre that explores the 
possibilities of science and technology beyond the boundaries of our current reality. Fantasy 
books transport readers into magical worlds filled with mythical creatures extraordinary 
adventures that require an author to create an entire universe with their own rules,
histories, and cultures. I know these are two different genres (sci-fi and fantasy fans don't 
stone me please. I just wanted both genres to be represented), the amount of world-building, 
imagination, and all around creativity required in writing and reading these books are comparable. 
These books blend science, unrestricted imagination, and literature in a fun and engaging way. 
These are some of the most popular books in both genres!

Searching Functionality: What are you interested in reading? I've only offered five categories 
to look through, which is not comprehensive at all. Simply search a topic and dive deep into 
the options available (according to Open Library)! I'm not 100% sure that Spotify will have
these available, but the beauty of books and modern technology is that there is definitely 
a book out there for you and multiple different ways to read it. Happy searching!
