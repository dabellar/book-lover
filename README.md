## Creative Project 3: Fetch and APIs

### About
Using both the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) and the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api), I made a book recommendation/search application with pre-selected categories each with their own CSS themes. 

### Inspiration/Planning Phase
In the "cp3-design-stage" folder, I added the images of the early ideas/iterations of this project from both me and my professor. It includes wireframes, flowcharts, and notes.

### Things I Would Change
Spotify (as of Sept 2024) doesn't recognize playlists of audiobooks as playlists with items in them. Therefore, I choose to make my own "playlists." I think I would find a better way to work around this obstacle if I could rework my approach. I also went into this project thinking I would do more with the Open Library API and Spotify API at the same time, so when I made the playlists I tried to have the most basic information (title and author) so I could access both data sets. Seeing how the project turned out, I would have have just made the playlists with the Spotify IDs instead.
